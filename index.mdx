## Authentication

All API requests require an API key. You can generate and manage your API key from the [Tellscope Dashboard](https://app.tellscope.io/settings).

```graphql
query {
  feedbackItems(apiKey: "tellscp_sk_...") {
    items {
      id
      title
    }
  }
}
```

<Note>
  Keep your API key secure. Never expose it in client-side code or public repositories.
